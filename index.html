        <h3>Welcome to OTRS on github.</h3>
        <p>
            All public repositories of OTRS can be found at <a href="https://github.com/OTRS">github</a>,
            for example the <a href="https://github.com/OTRS">OTRS framework itself</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Contributions</h3>
        <p>
            We are glad about all contributions that you may want to make.
            Please note that you need to accept the
            <a href="http://bugs.otrs.org/docs/pdf/OTRS-CLA.pdf">OTRS contributors agreement</a> once.
            This effectively means that you transfer the copyright of the code to OTRS.
            Please print and sign this document and <a href="mailto:cla@otrs.com?subject=Signed%20OTRS%20CLA">send us scan</a>
            and your github username.
        </p>

            While the <a href="http://doc.otrs.org/3.3/en/html/">administrator's manual</a> has lots of information about how to
            setup, use and tune OTRS, there is also a <a href="http://doc.otrs.org/developer/3.3/en/html/">developer's manual</a>
            that goes into the details of OTRS development. It can tell you
            <a href="http://doc.otrs.org/developer/3.3/en/html/get-started.html#development-environment">how to setup a development environment</a>
            and <a href="http://doc.otrs.org/developer/3.3/en/html/contributing.html">how you can contribute to OTRS</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The contributing section also has information about the
            <a href="http://doc.otrs.org/developer/3.3/en/html/code-style-guide.html">OTRS code style guide</a> that you should read and follow.
            We also recommend that you checkout and use <a href="https://github.com/OTRS/otrscodepolicy">the OTRSCodePolicy</a>
            module. You can run this manually on your code and/or register it as a git commit hook that will perform the
            checks every time that you commit. Please see
            <a href="https://github.com/OTRS/otrscodepolicy/blob/master/doc/en/OTRSCodePolicy.xml">the module documentation</a> for details.
            Using this module before sending a pull request is mandatory.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is also a debugging/analysis module that can help developers in their work: <a href="https://github.com/OTRS/Fred">Fred</a>.
            It has several helpful tools like an SQL log module, a STDERR log module, JSLint based JavaScript code style verification and a simple HTML best practice checker.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask on the
            <a href="http://lists.otrs.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/dev">developer's mailing list</a>.
        </p>
