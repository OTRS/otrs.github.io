First of all, we would like to give you an introduction\n        of what this design system is all about and how you can use it. Generally speaking, the design\n        system is a collection of components for the user interface of OTRS.

Each screen had it's\n        own perl frontend module and it's own html template (based on the template toolkit syntax).\n        To apply styles to this screen, OTRS would load some common CSS files and some screen specific\n        CSS files. Re-using elements on different places would basically happen by copying and pasting\n        HTML and CSS back and forth. Not only would this approach lead to inconsistencies across the\n        application, but it would also slow down the developer instead of helping them creating new\n        screens and features.\n    ")]),e._v(" "),t("p",[e._v('\n        For OTRS 7, we introduced a new approach: screens are no longer a monolithic composition of\n        elements and code in general, but an assembly of many different components.
