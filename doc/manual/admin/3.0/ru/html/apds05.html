conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified
Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must
do these things in the Modified Version:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="A"><li class="listitem"><p>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that
of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there
were any, be listed in the History section of the Document).  You may use
the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that
version gives permission.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version,
together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of
its principal authors, if it has less than five).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version,
as the publisher.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the
other copyright notices.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving
the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this
License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and
required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Include an unaltered copy of this License.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to it an
item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the
Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If there is no section
entitled "History" in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add
an item describing the Modified Version, as stated in the previous sentence.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public
access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network
locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on.
These may be placed in the "History" section.  You may omit a network
location for a work that was published at least four years before the
Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to
gives permission.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications", preserve the
section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of
each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text
and in their titles.  Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered
part of the section titles.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Delete any section entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section may not be
included in the Modified Version.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to conflict in
title with any Invariant Section.</p></li></ol></div><p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices
that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the
Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as
invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections
in the Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct
from any other section titles.</p><p>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains nothing
but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example,
statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an
organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</p><p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of
Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of Front-Cover Text
and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by)
any one entity.  If the Document already includes a cover text for the same
cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you
are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the
old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the
old one.</p><p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give
permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply
endorsement of any Modified Version.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="apds04.html">Пред.</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="gfdl.html">Уровень выше</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="apds06.html">След.</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">COPYING IN QUANTITY </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Начало</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> COMBINING DOCUMENTS</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
