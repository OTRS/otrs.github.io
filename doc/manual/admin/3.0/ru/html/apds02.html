placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms
of this License.  The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.
Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".</p><p>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the Document
or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.</p><p>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the
Document, that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or
authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related
matters), and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall
subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of
mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The
relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or
with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or
political position regarding them.</p><p>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are
designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says
that the Document is released under this License.</p><p>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed, as
Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the
Document is released under this License.</p><p>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
automatic translation to a variety of formats, suitable for input to text
formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format, whose
markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
"Opaque".</p><p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include: plain ASCII
without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using
a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for
human modification.  Opaque formats include: PostScript, PDF, proprietary
formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors
for output purposes only.</p><p>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such
following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License
requires to appear in the title page.  For works in formats which do not
have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near the most
prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the
body of the text.</p></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="gfdl.html">Пред.</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="gfdl.html">Уровень выше</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="apds03.html">След.</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Приложение D.
