This chapter offers a brief introduction to trouble ticket systems, along with explaining the core concept of a trouble ticket. A quick example demonstrates the advantages of using such a system.

The following example describes what a trouble ticket system is, and how you might benefit from using such a system at your company.
</p><p>
Let's imagine that Max is a manufacturer of video recorders. Max receives many mails from customers needing help with the devices. Some days, he is unable to respond promptly or even acknowledge the mails. Some customers get impatient and write a second mail with the same question. All mails containing support requests are stored in a single inbox file. The requests are not sorted, and Max answers the mails using a regular email program.
</p><p>
Since Max cannot reply fast enough to all the messages, he is assisted by the developers Joe and John in this. Joe and John use the same mail system, accessing the same inbox file. They don't know that Max often gets two identical requests  from a desperate customer. Sometimes they both end up responding separately to the same request, with the customer  receiving two different answers. Further, Max is unaware of the details of their responses. He is also unaware of the details of customer problems and their resolution, such as which problems occur with high frequency, or how much time and money he has to spend on customer support.
</p><p>
At a meeting, a colleague tells Max about trouble ticket systems and how they can solve Max's problems with customer support. After looking for information on the Internet, Max decides to install the Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) on a computer that is accessible from the web by both his customers and his employees. Now, the customer requests are no longer sent to Max's private inbox but to the mail account that is used for OTRS. The ticket system is connected to this mailbox and saves all requests in its database. For every new request, the system generates an auto-answer and sends it to the customer so that the customer knows that his request has arrived and will be answered soon. OTRS generates an explicit reference, the ticket number, for every single request. Customers are now happy because they receive an acknowledgement to their requests and it is not necessary to send a second message with the same question. Max, John and Joe can now login into OTRS with a simple web browser and answer the requests. Since the system locks a ticket that is answered, no message is edited twice.
</p><p>
Let's imagine that Mr. Smith makes a request to Max's company, and his message is processed by OTRS. John gives a brief reply to his question. But Mr. Smith has a follow-up question, which he posts via a reply to John's mail. Since John is busy, Max now answers Mr. Smith's message. The history function of OTRS allows Max to see the full sequence of communications on this request, and he responds with a more detailed reply. Mr. Smith does not know that multiple service representatives were involved in resolving his request, and he is happy with the details that arrived in Max's last reply.
</p><p>
Of course, this is only a short preview of the possibilities and features of trouble ticket systems. But if your company has to attend to a high volume of customer requests through mails and phone calls, and if different service representatives need to respond at different times, a ticket system can be of great help. It can help streamline work flow processes, add efficiencies and improve your overall productivity. A ticket system helps you to flexibly structure your Support or Help Desk environment. Communications between customers and service staff become more transparent. The net result is an increase in service effectiveness. And no doubt, satisifed customers will translate into better financial results for your company.
