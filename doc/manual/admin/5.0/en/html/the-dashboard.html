    The Dashboard is the main page of the system, here you can get an overview about the tickets and
    other stuff related to the ticket activity. It's thinking to be the starting point for the daily
    work of an agent, by default it presents a quick summary of the tickets which are pending,
    escalated, new, and open, among other information.
</p><p>
    One of the most important features about Dashboard is that is completely customizable. That
    means you that can configure each part as you want, showing or hiding elements. It's even
    possible to relocate this elements within the same column by clicking on and dragging the
    element's header, and dropping them elsewhere. Each element is named "Widget", the system has
    some widgets ready to use out of the box, but the modular design of the dashboard screen is
    prepared to integrate custom widgets easily.
</p><p>
    The content of this screen is arranged in two main columns, on the left column you normally can
    see information about tickets classified by their states like: reminder, escalated, new, and
    open. On each of this widgets you can filter the results to see all of the tickets that you are
    allowed to access, tickets you have locked, the ones that are located in agent defiend queues,
    among other filters. There are also other kind of widgets in this column and they are all
    described below.
