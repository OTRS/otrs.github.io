OTRS has the capability to sign or encrypt outgoing messages with PGP. Further, encrypted incoming messages can be decrypted. Encryption and decryption are done with the GPL tool GnuPG. To setup GnuPG for OTRS, the following steps have to be performed:
</p><p>
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>
    Install GnuPG, via the package manager of your operating system.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Configure GnuPG for use with OTRS. The necessary directories for GnuPG and a private key have to be created. The command shown in the script below has to be executed as user 'otrs' from a shell.
    </p><p>

    You need a user ID to identify your key; the software constructs the user ID

        "Heinrich Heine (Der Dichter) &lt;heinrichh@duesseldorf.de&gt;"

    Real name: Ticket System

    le.com) &lt;support@example.com&gt;"

    Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
    You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

    Passphrase: secret
    Repeat passphrase: secret

    We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
    some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
    disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
    generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

    <span class="emphasis"><em>Script: Configuring GnuPG.</em></span>
    </p><p>
		As shown in the script below, the default settings can be applied for most of the required parameters. Only the values for the key owner have to be entered correctly, with a proper password specified for the key.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Now OTRS has to be made ready to use PGP. From the Admin console, open the SysConfig interface and search for "PGP". Select the sub group Crypt::PGP from the search results.
    </p><p>
    In the screen for the PGP settings, PGP should be activated for OTRS (first option). Also, the path to the gpg program should be set and checked.
    </p><p>
    The next config setting (PGP::Options) may also require changing. Via this config setting, the parameters that are used for every execution of gpg by the 'otrs' user can be specified. In particular, the directory of the config files for GnuPG of the 'otrs' user is important. In the example <code class="filename">/opt/otrs/.gnupg</code> is used. This directory was created earlier during the PGP configuration.
    </p><p>
		Via the next config option (PGP::Key::Password) it is possible to specify the pairs of key IDs and their passwords for own private keys. Because communication partners from outside write to the ticket system with their messages encrypted with your public key, OTRS can decrypt these messages with the ID/passwords specified here.
    </p><p>
    How to get the id of your own private key? The ID of your own private key is already shown during the key generation (see step 1 from above). It is also possible to get the ID if the command specified in the following script is executed as user 'otrs':
    </p><p>
    </p><pre class="screen">
    linux:~# su otrs
    linux:/root$ cd
    linux:~$ pwd
    /opt/otrs
    linux:~$ gpg --list-keys
    /opt/otrs/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
    ----------------------------
    pub   1024D/7245A970 2006-02-03
    uid                  Ticket System (Private pgp key for ticket system with
    address support@example.com) &lt;support@example.com&gt;
    sub   2048g/52B97069 2006-02-03

    linux:~$
    </pre><p>
    </p><p>
    <span class="emphasis"><em>Script: Getting the ID of your own private key.</em></span>
    </p><p>
    The ID of the private key can be found in the line that starts with "sub". It is a hexadecimal string that is eight characters long, in the example above it is "52B97069". The password you have to specify for this key in the ticket system is the same that was given during key generation.
    </p><p>
    After this data is inserted, the "Update" button can be used to save the settings. OTRS is ready to receive and decrypt encoded messages now.
    </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
    Finally, import a customer's public key. This ensures that encrypted messages can be sent out to this customer. There are two ways to import a public key of a customer.
    </p><p>
    The first way is to specify the public key of a customer in the customer management interface.
    </p><p>
    The second way is to specify the key via the PGP settings, reachable from the Admin page. On the right section of this screen, all already imported public keys of customers are displayed. After PGP has been activated and configured for OTRS, your own public key should also be listed there. In the left area of the PGP setting screen it is possible to search for keys. Also, a new public key can be uploaded into the system from a file.
    </p><p>
    The files with the public key that need to be imported into OTRS have to be GnuPGP compatible key files. In most cases, the key stored in a file is an "ASCII armored key". OTRS can deal with this format.
