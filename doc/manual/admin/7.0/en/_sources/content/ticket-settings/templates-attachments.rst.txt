Templates ↔ Attachments
=======================

Making changes to standard attachments is sometimes overwhelming. The question is, "Where were the attachments used?" or "How to quickly update them across the board?" It's also important to know which are using which attachments, before updating them. A new attachment can have multiple uses within your organization.

OTRS empowers you to manage this providing you an overview to manage the 1:n relationships and quickly identify the templates using your attachments.

Use this screen to add one or more attachments to one or more templates. To use this function, at least one attachment and one template need to have been added to the system. The management screen is available in the *Templates ↔ Attachments* module of the *Ticket Settings* group.

   If several attachments or templates are added to the system, use the filter box to find a particular attachment or template by just typing the name to filter.

Multiple attachments or templates can be assigned in both screens at the same time. Additionally clicking on an attachment or clicking on a template will open the edit attachment screen or the edit template screen for the selected resource.
