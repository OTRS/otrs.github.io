SMS Templates ↔ Queues
======================

Communicating a change to a template, or distribution of a new communication requirement, can be tedious and error-ridden because it requires that all teams pull the information and publish it appropriately.

OTRS gives you the power to quickly assign the appropriate SMS templates to any queue, containing pertinent ticket information, ensuring this information reaches your customers and agents.

Use this screen to add one or more SMS templates to one or more queues. The management screen is available in the *SMS Templates ↔ Queues* module of the *Ticket Settings* group.

Multiple SMS templates or queues can be assigned in both screens at the same time. Additionally clicking on an SMS template or clicking on a queue in the *Relations screens* will open the edit SMS template screen or the edit queue screen accordingly.

   Accessing a queue or template provides no backlink to the *Relations screen*.
