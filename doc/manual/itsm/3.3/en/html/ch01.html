        IT is expected to consistently deliver high service quality in an
        increasingly complex field. In this context, effective and efficient
        incident and problem management are indispensable. However, IT service
        management remains a task almost impossible if there is no consistent
        and up-to-date database with information about the state and
        configuration of the IT infrastructure.
    </p><p>
        The IT Infrastructure Library®, short ITIL®, is a series of books
        published by the United Kingdom's Office of Government Commerce (OGC),
        which generically combine best practice approaches to designing,
        providing, operating and managing IT services. ITIL does not focus on
        the technology but the services provided by the IT and comprises
        information on processes, roles, responsibilities, potential problem
        fields/resolutions, and definitions of terms.
    </p><p>
        ITIL has established itself as de facto standard over the past
        years and its circulation in IT organizations has contributed considerably
        to the development of a collective awareness and consistent
        terminology for IT service management. However, ITIL only describes
        "who should do what" and what should be considered along the
        way. In order to cover as wide a user group as possible, it does not
        or to a little extent address the issue of how to do things.
        Therefore, no implementable information is given for particular
        industries, companies, or manufacturers.
    </p><p>
        In December 2005, the ITIL based ISO/IEC 20000 industry standard
        for IT service management was published. IT organizations can apply
        for ISO/IEC 20000 certification and prove their conformity.
    </p><p>
        The continuing boom caused demand for IT service management
        tools, which could represent the ITIL-based processes. So far, only
        proprietary solutions existed. Because of their considerable
        complexity, most of these tools are only affordable for large
        companies and effective in large IT departments.
    </p><p>
        The development of OTRS ITSM was started as a result of the
        great success of the OTRS framework in order to combine the
        globally accepted, public ITIL recommendations with the benefits
        of open-source software.
    </p><p>
        OTRS ITSM 1.0 was the first real-world ITIL compliant IT service
        management solution on open-source basis, built on the solid basis
        of OTRS with its over 55,000 known OTRS installations and its
        community (information dating from April 2007). OTRS ITSM is under
        active development and new features are added continuously.
    </p><p>
        OTRS ITSM is practically-oriented. This was accomplished by
        developing it in collaboration with ITIL consultants and with
        some of OTRS Groups' customers.
    </p><p>
        The service-desk and ticket system solution OTRS is the basis
        for the ITIL compliant IT service management solution
        OTRS ITSM, its incident management, problem management, service level
        management, change and configuration management modules, and integrated
        CMDB.
    </p><p>

                            Integrated Feature AddOn "OTRSServiceIncidentState" into OTRS ITSM.
                            It shows the current incident state of a selected service in the ticket zoom, and in all agent frontends where
                            a service can be selected (can be disabled on a per screen basis).

                            This feature makes it possible to configure the shown CI-Attributes individually for each ConfigItem class.
                            This is possible for the CI-Overview, the CI-Search-Overview and the Linked-CI view in the agent interface.

                            Integrated Feature AddOn "OTRSWorkOrderTimeDependency" into OTRS ITSM.
                            If this feature is enabled and you change the planned end date of a workorder, all following workorders will also be moved accordingly, so that the time differences between the workorders will still be the same.

                            Integrated Feature AddOn "OTRSCIAttributeSyntaxCheck" into OTRS ITSM.
                            This feature makes it possible to check the syntax of CI attributes with a regular expression while adding or editing CIs via the agent interface (not while importing CIs with the Import/Export module).
                            CI attributes of the type "Text" and "TextArea", as well as the CI name can be checked with individual regular expressions.
                            An individual error message is shown if the attribute does not match the defined pattern.
                            With this feature it can be enforced that for example a CI attribute must start with "ABC" or must end with a number.

                            Added new feature "WorkOrder Report Attachments" into OTRS ITSM.
                            This feature adds support for attachment uploads in the workorder report screen.
                        </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
                            The toolbar icons now use an icon font which makes it easier to create custom skins with different base colors.

                            Each object like Service/SLA, Location, CI, Linkobject now creates a

                            Services can be assigned to authorized customers. Further more,
                            services may be assigned as general 'default services' which are
                            valid to use for each customer.

                            A view on services and CIs, including information
                            on each object's current state, allows you to analyze an incident
                            and calculate the incident's impact on affected services and
                            customers.

                            As an enhancement of the service view, now SLAs and linked CIs are
                            also displayed.
                            For each CI, the current incident state is shown. In addition, the incident
                            state
                            will be propagated for dependent SLAs and CIs.

                            If a service is selected, the service details will be shown, now
                            with the additional
                            'current incident state', which is calculated from the incident states of
                            dependent
                            services and CIs.

                            CIs are now enhanced with a 'current incident state', which includes
                            two state types:

                            For each state type, any number of states can be registered.
                            The state of a CI affects the service state, which will be
                            dynamically calculated, and can
                            have one of the following three values:

                            The propagation of the incident state will be carried out if CIs are
                            linked with the link type 'depend on'.

                            CMDB Import/Export (CSV and API)
                        </p><p>
                            This feature offers the possibility to import or update data from CSV
                            files into the CMBD of OTRS ITSM, and to export data from the
                            CMDB to CSV files.
                            Each line of the CSV file describes one CI, with the data of the CI
                            in the columns.
                        </p><p>
                            The import and export is controlled with ImEx definitions. These
                            definitions map the columns of the CSV file to the fields in the
                            CMDB. You can create an ImEx definition via the admin interface
                            in OTRS. For each available field in the CMDB, the corresponding
                            column in the CSV file needs to be defined. This is done in a
                            form, which represents the current CI definition. Also, a filter
                            can be applied, to limit the number of the exported CIs.
                            Any number of ImEx definitions can be stored in the system, and each
                            definition can be used for import and for export.
                        </p><p>
                            To start an import (exports work the same way), two possibilities
                            exist: interactive with the web interface, or automatically with
                            a script.
                            Using the interactive way, the desired ImEx definition is selected,
                            and then the CSV file is uploaded to the system. During the
                            interactive export, the CSV file will be offered for download
                            respectively.
                        </p><p>
                            The automatic import is carried out via a script, which requires the
                            name of the ImEx definition and the name of the CSV file as
                            arguments. During the script based export, the CIs that were
                            given the script as arguments will be saved in a CSV file.
                            Before the execution of the import or export, the selected ImEx
                            definition will be compared with the current CI definition. If
                            inconsistencies are found, the process will be cancelled. Also,
                            during import, restrictions in the CI definition (e.g. mandatory
                            fields) will be checked. If applicable, the data record is
                            rejected, but the import process continues. An import protocol
                            can be found in the syslog.
                            Via the API the CSV based import/export can be replaced or enhanced
                            by other formats/transports, like direct database access or XML.
                            The implementation of the CSV interface can be used as a
                            reference.

                OTRS ITSM is based on an integrated configuration management
                data base (CMDB), which serves as the foundation for the
                comprehensive control of the service management processes. It
                represents the configuration items (CI), their complex relationships,
                and interdependencies with each other and with other components of
                the service chain.

                        When creating a ticket, the customer can select a service (e.g.
                        e-mail service) and a corresponding SLA. SLA attributes are
                        "response time", "update time" and
