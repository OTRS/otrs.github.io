Customer Users ↔ Customers
==========================

In an organization, for example, which views its customers as it's departments and teams, a customer user may have to have access to multiple customers tickets for controlling purposes. Maybe you have partners who represent several different companies, or a corporation wants to have a look at all the requests of their subsidiaries.

For all situations, OTRS provides the means. Aside from a primary customer, your customer users can gain access to multiple customer tickets as defined by you.

Use this screen to add one or more customer users to one or more customers. To use this function, at least one customer user and one customer need to have been added to the system. The management screen is available in the *Customer Users ↔ Customers* module of the *Users, Groups & Roles* group.
