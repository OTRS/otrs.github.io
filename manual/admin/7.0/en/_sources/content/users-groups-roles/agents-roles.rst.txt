Agents ↔ Roles
==============

As an organization grows, groups cannot be the denominator used for processing access rights. Roles become more and more a need because a role has a special set of permissions assigned. One mustn't give individual permissions, but the role carries the permissions built-in.

OTRS allows easy access to a predefined set of permissions via one or more roles defined. These roles are assigned easily to one or more agents, or one or more agent to a role.

Use this screen to add one or more agents to one or more roles. To use this function, at least one agent and one role need to have been added to the system. The management screen is available in the *Agents ↔ Roles* module of the *Users, Groups & Roles* group.
